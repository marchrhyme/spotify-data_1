# Spotify and Netflix Recommendation Systems

## Overview
This repository contains projects that build recommendation systems for Spotify and Netflix using Python. These systems aim to provide personalized suggestions for songs and media content based on user behavior and preferences.

## Projects

### Spotify Recommendation System
The Spotify Recommendation System project utilizes data such as track features and user preferences to suggest songs. This system is built using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering methods to enhance user experience.

#### Files:
- `spotify-recommendation#0.ipynb`: Initial data exploration and preprocessing steps for the Spotify recommendation system.
- `FINAL_spotify-recommendation-system.ipynb`: Final implementation of the Spotify recommendation system, including model training and evaluation.

### Netflix Recommendation System
The Netflix Recommendation System project is designed to recommend movies and TV shows based on user viewing history and preferences. It leverages machine learning techniques to predict user ratings for unseen content.

#### Files:
- `Netflix_recommendation-for_Github.ipynb`: Complete implementation of the Netflix recommendation system, including data processing, model building, and evaluation.
 
## Usage
Each notebook is self-contained and provides step-by-step instructions and explanations for building the recommendation systems. Follow the instructions within the notebooks to understand the data processing, model training, and evaluation processes.
